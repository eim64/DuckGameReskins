# DuckGameReskins
This is basically Armytecel's clientreskins mod, but with all features as normal reskins plus a couple extra stuff.

You make a .rsk file using the ReskinMaker application and put it in the steamapps\common\DuckGame folder and it should appear ingame.
If others have the mod the skin will be shown to them aswell.

# New feutures
I made it so that you can make hd skins by changing the sprite size in settings
And i added capes

# Stuff im too lazy to do rn
Letting you have custom animations: This is pretty easy to do since i made good code that is easy to expand, but i have to make UI so...
Custom quack sounds: I've done UI so i basically just need to encode it to some other format that doesnt take a million bytes.
